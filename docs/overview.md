# Overview

The BDDL codebase has three primary sections: the BDDL language and its usage in activity definitions, the core BDDL API, and requirements for a simulator to be used with BDDL/BEHAVIOR. Given a simulator and an agent deployed in it, BDDL is typically used to instantiate a BEHAVIOR activity definition in the simulator, then check the agent's progress/success at every step.
