"""
Purpose:
This is the script that generates the 'hierarchy.json' file that will be necessary
for many purposes like initial/goal state annotation, object shopping list annotation,
and scene generation in iGATUS. 

Generate 3 types of hierarchy.json:
    - Hierarchy of just the owned models for scene generation and object sampling.
    - Hierarchy of the union of all of the owned models + objects extracted from online articles.
    - Hierarchy of just the objects from online articles, this is our most unbiased object distribution.

To Run:
- Make sure that the .csv files and the .json file are updated (see ### Dependencies).
- python3 hierarchy_generator.py
