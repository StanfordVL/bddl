"""
The program takes in UpWorker's .csv survey data, Manual Annotations (Canonical), and GPT Annotations (Canonical) and merges them.
This merged canonical is then run through the Programmatic Annotation system to create a Master Canonical. (Note: Master /= Final)
The Final step for the Master is to be run through propogate_by_intersection.py which has not been completed

Separately, once Master has been compiled, the two hierarchy generation functions will be run. The first function generates a hierarchy of all
